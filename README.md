# AWS SageMaker End-to-End Machine Learning Project

AWS SageMaker End-to-End Machine Learning Project

This comprehensive project is designed to take you through the entire workflow of implementing a machine learning project using AWS SageMaker.
## Project Overview

### 1: Introduction to AWS SageMaker

- Overview of SageMaker, S3, EC2 & IAM features and capabilities
- Setting up AWS environment and SageMaker instance

### 2: GitHub Setup & Data Cleaning

- Setting up local & remote repository using GitHub
- Data Cleaning using Numpy and Pandas best practices

### 3: Exploratory Data Analysis

- Understanding the workflow of systematically analyzing datasets
- Understanding the various plots, statistical measures, and hypothesis tests to analyze datasets

### 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (continued)

- Exploring a custom EDA module for convenience and significantly reduce complexity of analyzing datasets
- Performing in-depth analysis of various kinds of numeric, categorical, and date-time variables
- Leveraging statistical measures, hypothesis tests, and univariate, bivariate, and multivariate plots

### 5: Feature Engineering and Data Preprocessing
